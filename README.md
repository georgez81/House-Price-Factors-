# House-Price-Factors-

In this project I analyzed house sale prices from 1460 houses sold in Ames, Iowa from 2006-2010. I first queried the data from SQL in PGAdmin. Then I developed dashboards to assist shareholders within an investment bank in determining factors that drive housing prices and how they should allocate dollars earmarked for investment into mortgage-backed securities. The dashboard data was supported through t-tests, A/A tests, and Z-tests run on housing price factors showing statistical significance.

In essence, I manipulated different categorical data types and compared either the difference in proportions of houses bought/sold (Z-test) or the difference in mean sale price (2 tail T-test). A/A tests were used to check for bias in the control group.
